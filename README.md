# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** with transactional data from an online retail dataset. The analysis identifies distinct customer segments to help optimize marketing strategies and improve decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and combines datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates `TotalPrice` and a binary `HighValue` feature.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes a correlation heatmap and statistical insights.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Identifies customer segments using the Elbow Method for optimal clusters.
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Visualizes clusters in 2D space.
- **Cluster Summary**: Provides key characteristics of each segment.
